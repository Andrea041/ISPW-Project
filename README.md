# Prototype of an e-commerce application for Software Engineering course
The application is an e-commerce platform designed for retailers of swimming sports articles who wish to expand their customer base by leveraging the capabilities offered by
internet technology. A customer can browse and select products of interest, adding them to the cart after choosing the desired size and quantity. In the cart, they can preview the total 
price of the items, modify the quantity, or remove unwanted products. Proceeding to the checkout process, the customer enters a shipping address or uses one already saved in the system. The 
final step of the purchasing procedure involves selecting a payment method between PayPal and credit card. For credit card payments, customers can use a card already saved in the system if 
available. Upon successful payment, an order summary is displayed.
The seller can view incoming orders and accept or reject them, for example, if there are discre- pancies between the availability of items on the website and in the warehouse. Customers, 
upon logging in, are notified of the acceptance or rejection of their orders.
